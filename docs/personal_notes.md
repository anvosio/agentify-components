So the reason we have form and stuff is becuase, they can put the decorator on the form and we can extract the input fields from the form and then we can use that to generate the tool, including the behavior which is if the user clicks on the button, then we can use the behavior to navigate to the page or call the api.


If it is call the api, then we can use the behavior to call the api and return the response.

If it is navigation, then we can use the behavior to navigate to the page.
