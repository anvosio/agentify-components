# Product Requirements Document: Agentify Components Framework

## 1. Executive Summary

Agentify Components is a React framework that enhances UI components with semantic metadata, making them "agent-aware" and enabling rich interactions with AI systems and automation tools. By wrapping standard UI components with higher-order components (HOCs), developers can declaratively specify the behavior, purpose, and capabilities of their components in a format that can be understood by AI agents.

**Version:** 0.0.1  
**Package:** @anvos/agentify-components

## 2. Problem Statement

Modern web applications have complex UI components that are not easily understandable by AI assistants and automation tools and rely on manually figuring out how to interact with them through trial and error. 

Specfically, when an AI agent interacts with these applications, it lacks context about:

- What a component does
- How to interact with it
- What type of data it handles
- Its relationship to other components

Developers need a standardized way to make their UI components "self-describing" to enable richer AI-powered experiences and workflows.

## 4. Product Features

### 4.1 Core Component HOCs

#### 4.1.1 Search Bar Agentification
- **Priority:** High
- **Description:** HOC for enhancing search components with metadata
- **Requirements:**
  - Support both navigation-based and API-based search behaviors
  - Capture search intent and parameters
  - Validate configuration

#### 4.1.2 Form Agentification
- **Priority:** High
- **Description:** HOC for enhancing form components with metadata
- **Requirements:**
  - Support for field-level metadata
  - Form purpose declaration
  - Support both navigation and API submission methods

#### 4.1.3 Button Agentification
- **Priority:** High
- **Description:** HOC for enhancing button components with metadata
- **Requirements:**
  - Support navigation, API calling, and UI interaction behaviors
  - Button purpose and target declaration

### 4.2 Component Registry

- **Priority:** High
- **Description:** Central system to register and manage component metadata
- **Requirements:**
  - Unique ID generation for each component
  - Configuration validation
  - Runtime component registration

### 4.3 MCP Configuration Generation

- **Priority:** Medium
- **Description:** Tools to generate MCP (Model Context Protocol) configuration from registered components
- **Requirements:**
  - Template generation for MCP configuration
  - Build-time generation
  - Export for use with external systems

### 4.4 Configuration Validation

- **Priority:** Medium
- **Description:** Validation system for component configurations
- **Requirements:**
  - Type-specific validation rules
  - Helpful error messages
  - Runtime validation

## 5. Success Metrics

- **Developer Adoption:** Number of projects using the framework
- **Component Coverage:** Percentage of UI components that are "agentified"
- **AI Integration:** Number of AI tools/agents successfully using the component metadata
- **Performance Impact:** Bundle size increase and runtime performance overhead

## 6. Constraints and Limitations

- React-only support in initial version
- No direct support for other frameworks (Vue, Angular, etc.)
- Limited to client-side component registration
- Requires components to be rendered at least once for registration

## 7. Future Considerations

- Static analysis tools to extract component metadata
- Visual editor for component configuration
- Protocol-agnostic implementation
- AI agent SDK for consuming component metadata
- Standardization of metadata format across the industry


Key findings indicate that while there are no direct competitors offering AI-aware UI components, there is a significant market opportunity given the increasing demand for AI integration in development workflows.

The technical approach is feasible, but several enhancements are recommended:

Add TypeScript support from the beginning
Implement automated metadata generation tools
Develop VS Code extension for better developer experience
Create build-time optimization tools
Add performance monitoring utilities



## 11. Appendix

### 11.1 Example Usage

```jsx
// Search bar example
const EnhancedSearch = agentifySearchBar({
  behavior: {
    type: 'api',
    endpoint: '/api/search',
    method: 'GET'
  },
  description: 'Product search'
})(SearchComponent);

// Form example
const LoginForm = agentifyForm({
  behavior: {
    type: 'api',
    endpoint: '/api/login',
    method: 'POST'
  },
  fields: [
    { name: 'username', type: 'text', required: true },
    { name: 'password', type: 'password', required: true }
  ],
  purpose: 'user-authentication'
})(FormComponent);
```

### 11.2 Metadata Schema

```javascript
// Component Metadata Schema
{
  id: String,              // Unique identifier
  type: String,            // Component type
  behavior: Object,        // Behavior configuration
  description: String,     // Human-readable description
  selector: String,        // CSS selector (optional)
  registeredAt: Date       // Registration timestamp
}
```
